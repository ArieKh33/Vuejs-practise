# Vuejs-practise

This project is made to practise getting used to using vuejs.


## Why have I made this?

I thought of a more fun way to learn or understand new techniques, and making a small library of what I'm capable of is really fun to me.



### What features does it currently have and what will I see in the future?

2. Editing values with ref() in a page
